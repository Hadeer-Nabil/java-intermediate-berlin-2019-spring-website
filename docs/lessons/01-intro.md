## Homework

Write a program that for given value of variable “height” will print out right-half of the christmas tree to the console. 

- Tree starts with “I” on the top and ends with “M” on the bottom. 
- Tree is built from “X” and “Y” characters one after another

For example for `height` equals 6 it will print:

```
I
XY
XYX
XYXY
XYXYX
M
```


```java
package com.example.demo;

public class TreeExercise {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int height = 8;

        // put your code here
    }
}
```
